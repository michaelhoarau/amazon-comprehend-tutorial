# Amazon Comprehend tutorials
*Experiment on Amazon Comprehend with the console or the APIs*

Amazon Comprehend is a machine learning service that provides semantic analysis of unstructured texts. In this repository, you will find a tutorial to walk you through the usage of this service with two different methods:

1. For the first method, you will only use the service console and this will be 100% no-code: WIP.
2. For the second method, you will fire up a SageMaker Notebook Instance and perform exactly the same process by using the Amazon Comprehend API.
